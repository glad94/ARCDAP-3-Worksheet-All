You’ll now move on to computing more in-depth model evaluation with ESMValTool and Python.The subsequent exercises will be more difficult with less “hand-holding” involved. Nevertheless, feel free to approach our ESMValTool developers and experts if you’re stuck or facing any issues. Happy coding!\n",
